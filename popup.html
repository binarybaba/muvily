            <p>Hi, I'm <a href="http://allrightamin.xyz" target="_blank">Amin Mohamed Ajani</a> and <em>this</em> is jackass. 
            <br>
            <br>
        I made this extension because I was too lazy to check the imdb Rating before deciding to watch a movie or a series or a mini-series or whatever. <br> <br>
        This extension uses the API created by <a href="mailto:bfritz@fadingsignal.com" target="_blank">Brian Fritz</a> who's super awesome. Hey Brian! <br> 
        In <em>no</em> way am I or this extension associated with IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes.
